📊 Student Performance Dashboard

Hi! This is a simple project I made to understand how students perform in different subjects.  
I used "Power BI", "Excel", and a bit of "Python" to analyze the data and create a dashboard.



🛠 Tools I Used

- Power BI – to make the dashboard  
- Excel – to clean the data  
- Python – for basic data analysis

🔍 What This Project Shows

- Marks scored by students in different subjects  
- Comparison between boys and girls  
- Top-scoring students  
- Easy filters to explore the data
